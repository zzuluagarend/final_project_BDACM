But I would say that the general principle is this: You have an oven made of concrete/stone/a kind of metal (??) with an opening through which you can send the dead body, litter or whatever you want to incinerate into the inner part of the oven. It is possible to seal the opening again, either by a mechanic or automatic kind of door or because you put the thing you want to incinerate in a kind of drawer which you push into the oven. Then the oven is heated (Hot air is blown into the oven? How? GAP) to a few hundred degrees, so that the thing in the oven catches fire (at least it's like that in a crematorium). Through a kind of pipe or chimney, the exhaust gases are lead outside and the remains of what is burnt are caught in a kind of container in the lower part of the oven. There might be several steps of combustion with different temperatures in different parts of the oven.
