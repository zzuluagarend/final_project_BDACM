Healthcare. First of all, there's a two-class system, so to speak. We've got private and public insurance. Private insurance is mostly used by public officials (like teachers), freelancers and self-employees - I don't know much about private insurance, except those people have to collect receipts for every visit to a doctor and/or hospital, every medication they get, etc and hand them in to their insurance. Also, a private insurance company may reject you as a customer. And then there's the rumor that privately insured people get treated better, earlier, faster and whatnot, but I think that's mostly that: a rumor.\nOn to the public part then. Everyone in Germany can get health insurance and even the poorest people get it paid for - mostly, but not always and certainly not unconditionally. The most common case is probably a common employee, no matter if blue or white collar, big company or small private business (except for the owner of the small private business, as mentioned above). The common employee cannot even opt-out of health insurance, as far as I know. The cost of the insurance is split between employer/company and employee and the amount is based on income (private insurance is calculated more or less individually, afaik). Although there are many public insurance companies, there isn't too much of a difference among them. Some offer certain programs (like, some might pay for a massage when in back-pain, others offer visits to a health resort resorth or even pay for your preffered choice of overpriced sugar pills9, but they all got your basics covered and they don't differ much in raw premium.\nThen again: what qualifies as ""basics""? Usually, there has to be some sort of evidence for a therapy to work in order for the insurance company to pay for it.

But I would say that the general principle is this: You have an oven made of concrete/stone/a kind of metal (??) with an opening through which you can send the dead body, litter or whatever you want to incinerate into the inner part of the oven. It is possible to seal the opening again, either by a mechanic or automatic kind of door or because you put the thing you want to incinerate in a kind of drawer which you push into the oven. Then the oven is heated (Hot air is blown into the oven? How? GAP) to a few hundred degrees, so that the thing in the oven catches fire (at least it's like that in a crematorium). Through a kind of pipe or chimney, the exhaust gases are lead outside and the remains of what is burnt are caught in a kind of container in the lower part of the oven. There might be several steps of combustion with different temperatures in different parts of the oven. In the end, the heating is turned off and the container with what has been incinerated can be pulled out.",3,6,What immigration policies in your country declare,1,How the internet works,How the inflation rate is calculated,How Healthcare system in your country works,1532539569402,How Healthcare system in your country works,1,How an incinerator works,1,How piano keys make sounds,20,1029142,3,,graduated_high_school,How an incinerator works,How a photocopier makes copies,German,How WiFi connection works,"In my country, every person has a health insurance.
